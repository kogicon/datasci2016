README for Data Science Final Project Report
Analyzing usersâ€™ music listening habits and the effect of track number on song popularity

How to get code running for the different components of our project:

To Run our Application:
from app directory (./app), run: node app.js
Then go to: http://localhost:8888 to try the app. You'll need a spotify username and password.




For Visualizations of Track Number (Music Centric) data:
from top directory, run: python visualization_code/vistracknumber.py
(filepaths are semi-hard coded, so be sure to run from top dir or change filepath)
To get various visualizations, it is required to manually edit the data displayed.

For Visualizations of Hipster Score (User Centric) data:
from top directory, run: python visualization_code/vishipsterscore.py
(filepaths are semi-hard coded, so be sure to run from top dir or change filepath)
